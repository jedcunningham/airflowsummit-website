I'm currently a software engineer on the big data platform team in Pinterest where our focus is on the workflow platform. We are migrating from old systems to this new one, which is built around airflow. Prior to here, I was on the data engineering team at Pandora where I first started exploring workflow systems and brought in a service built around Airflow there.
Outside of software, I help my family operate two pizza shops so coding and cooking are in my DNA!
