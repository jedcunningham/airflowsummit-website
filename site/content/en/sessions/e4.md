Superset is the leading open source data exploration and visualization platform. In this talk, we'll be presenting Superset with a focus on advanced topics that are most relevant to Data Engineers. The presentation will be largely a live demo of the product, with a deeper dive into these advanced topics:
* working with Jinja templates in SQL Lab - Superset's builtin SQL IDE
* scheduling SQL jobs in Superset using Airflow
* extending Superset with new visualization plugins
* building charts and dashboards dynamically

*This is a sponsored talk, presented by [Preset](https://preset.io).*
