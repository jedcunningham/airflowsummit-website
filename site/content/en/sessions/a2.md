This talk covers an overview of Airflow as well as lessons learned of its implementation in a banking production environment which is Société Générale. It will be the summary of a two-year experience, a storytelling of an adventure within Société Générale in order to offer an internal cloud solution based on Airflow (AirflowaaS).

I will cover the following points:

1. As part of the search for an open source solution for the replacement of a proprietary orchestration suite, we carried out a study that allowed us to choose Apache Airflow as a solution, but why ?

2. The different implementation models (HA, Scalability, ..)

3. How to manage an Airflow platforms in production with 45,000 runs per month?
