Astronomer is focused on improving Airflow’s user experience through the entire lifecycle — from authoring + testing DAGs, to building containers and deploying the DAGs, to running and monitoring both the DAGs and the infrastructure that they are operating within — with an eye towards increased security and governance as well.

In this talk, Ry Walker (CTO of Astronomer), Maxime Beauchemin (creator of Airflow and Superset/CEO of Preset) and Viraj Parekh (Director of Field Engineering at Astronomer), will walk you through some current UX challenges, an overview of how the Astronomer platform addresses the major challenges, and also provide sneak peek of the things that we’re working on in the coming months to improve Airflow’s user experience.

*This is a sponsored talk, presented by [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io).*
