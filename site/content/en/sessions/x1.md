Engaging with a new community is a common experience in OSS development.
There are usually expectations held by the project about the contributor's exposure 
to the community, and by the contributor about interactions with the community. 
When these expectations are misaligned, the process is strained. In this talk, 
I'll discuss a real life experience that required communication, 
persistence, and patience to ultimately lead to a positive outcome.
