While Airflow is a central product for data engineering teams, it’s usually one piece of a bigger puzzle. The vast majority of teams use Airflow in combination with other tools like Spark, Snowflake, and BigQuery. Making sure pipelines are reliable, detecting issues that lead to SLA misses, and identifying data quality problems requires deep visibility into DAGs and data flows. Join this session to learn how Databand’s observability system makes it easy to monitor your end-to-end pipeline health and quickly remediate issues.
