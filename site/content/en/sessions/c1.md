In PayPal we decided to move away from two of our enterprise schedulers, Control-M and UC4, to Airflow. 
As we started the journey, the first most important step that we wanted to take was to build all the mandatory APIâ€™s on the top of Airflow so that we could integrate with our Self-Service Tools. 

In this talk we will share the challenges that we ran into while building APIs on top of Airflow and how we overcame them.
