At Bluevine we use Airflow to drive our ML platform. In this talk, I'll present the challenges and gains we had at transitioning from a single server running Python scripts with cron to a full blown Airflow setup. This includes: supporting multiple Python versions,  event driven DAGs, performance issues and more!

Some of the points that I'll cover are:

- Supporting multiple Python versions
- Event driven DAGs 
- Airflow Performance issues and how we circumvented them
- Building Airflow plugins to enhance observability 
- Monitoring Airflow using Grafana
- CI for Airflow DAGs (super useful!)
- Patching Airflow scheduler
