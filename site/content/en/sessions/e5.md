Scribd is migrating its data pipeline from an in house system to Airflow. It’s a one big giant data pipeline consisting of more than 1,500 tasks. In this talk, I would like to share couple best practices on setting up a cloud native Airflow deployment in AWS. For those who are interested in migrating a non-trivial data pipeline to Airflow, I will also share how Scribd plans and executes the migration.

Here are some of the topics that will be covered:
* How to setup a highly available Airflow cluster in AWS using both ECS and EKS with Terraform.
* How to manage Airflow DAGs across multiple git repositories.
* How we manage Airflow variables using a custom Airflow Terraform provider.
* Best practices on monitoring multiple Airflow clusters with Datadog and Pagerduty.
* How to Airflow to make it feature parity with Scribd’s in house orchestration system.
* How to plan and execute non-trivial data pipeline migrations. We transcompiled internal DSL to Airflow DAG to simulate what a real run will look like to surface performance issues early in the process.
* How we fixed an Airflow performance bottleneck so our giant DAG can be properly rendered in Web UI.
