### Airflow Contributor Workshop: Advanced
*Instructor: [Jarek Potiuk](https://github.com/potiuk), Apache Airflow Committer & PMC member.*  

In the Beginner workshop you learned how to contribute small changes to Apache Airflow - and it is a prerequisite to Advanced Workshop. In this workshop you will learn about the internal architecture of the core Apache Airflow (Executors, TaskRunners, Scheduler internals), about the philosophy behind Airflow and why some design choices were made. You will learn how to improve and test the advanced features of Apache Airflow and what is planned to be implemented in the future versions of Airflow. You will learn about the mechanics of the discussion in the Apache Airflow community, about the AIP process and how to engage community members in meaningful discussions.

### Hands-on workshop: Getting started with Apache Airflow 
*Instructor: [Fokko Driesprong](https://github.com/Fokko), Apache Airflow Committer & PMC member.*  

In this workshop we’ll give you a full introduction into Airflow. No prior Airflow knowledge is required, only GIT and a Python IDE needs to be installed on your laptop. You need to have a basic understanding of the Python programming language. This workshop is based on Cloud Composer on the Google Cloud, which makes it easy for everyone to get started and have your first DAG up and running at the end of the day. This workshop will go over all the theory behind Airflow, visit the terminology, and start writing our first DAG. We’ll go over the architecture and when to use Airflow. Followed by some more example exercises with some conditional branching and make use of the features that make Airflow so powerful, such as backfilling and templating. We’ll end up with a end to end pipeline, build using best practies, where we fetch data from an external source, and publish this into BigQuery. After this workshop you should feel comfortable to write, monitor and debug your own DAGs.
