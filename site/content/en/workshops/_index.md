On June 3rd, we will have the following preconference workshops:

### Airflow Contributor Workshop: Beginner
By attending this workshop, you will learn how you can become a contributor to the Apache Airflow project. You will learn how to setup a development environment, how to pick your first issue, how to communicate effectively within the community and how to make your first PR - experienced committers of Apache Airflow project will give you step-by-step instructions and will guide you in the process. When you finish the workshop you will be equipped with everything that is needed to make further contributions to the Apache Airflow project.

### Airflow Contributor Workshop: Advanced
By attending this workshop, you will learn how you can contribute to the Apache Airflow project for more advanced topics. From the "First Time contributor's workshop" you learned how to contribute small changes to Apache Airflow - and it is a prerequisite to Advanced Workshop. In the advanced workshop you will learn about the internal architecture of the core Apache Airflow (Executors, TaskRunners, Scheduler internals), about the philosophy behind Airflow and why some design choices were made. You will learn how to improve and test the advanced features of Apache Airflow and what is planned to be implemented in the future versions of Airflow. You will learn about the mechanics of the discussion in the Apache Airflow community, about the AIP process and how to engage community members in meaningful discussions. Experienced committers of the Apache Airflow project will provide their guidelines and discuss with you ideas that you might bring on improving Apache Airflow. When you finish the workshop you will be equipped with everything that is needed to make further contributions to the Apache Airflow project.
 
### Apache Airflow workshop
In this workshop we’ll give you a full introduction into Airflow. No prior Airflow knowledge is required, only Docker installed on your computer, an internet connection and basic understanding of Python. We’ll go over all the theory behind Airflow, visit the terminology, and start writing our first hello world DAG. Followed by some more examples with some conditional branching and make use of the features that make Airflow unique, such as backfilling and templating. We’ll end up with a full pipeline. After this workshop you should feel comfortable to write, monitor and debug your own DAGs.
