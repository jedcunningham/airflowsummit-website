Jarek is an ex-CTO of a company which he grew from 6 to 60 people and then decided to go back to a full-time engineering career. Jarek has been worked as an engineer in many industries - Telecoms, Mobile app development, Google, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence - but for the last 1.5 years Cloud and Open Source data processing and Apache Airflow particularly is the main day (and sometimes nights and weekends) job for him. Jarek is currently PMC and Committer in the Apache Airflow project. Jarek likes to use his voice - for almost 30 years he sang in a choir and recently he ventured into learning voice lectoring and dubbing.
