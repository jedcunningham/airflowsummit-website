I graduated from Virginia Tech in Spring of 2019 as a Computer Science Major. I have been working at Nielsen for about a year as a Software engineer in their Emerging Technologies Program. I work with Nielsen Digitals Site Reliability Engineering team and Collections Platform team. Over the course of my time here I have deep dived into Kubernetes to enable us too more easily create, maintain, and deploy our workflows, while also having much more control of our resources to reduce cloud infrastructure costs. I am passionate about the movement to cloud native services on Kubernetes and am determined to contribute to it. I have actively contributed to Airflows open source stable helm chart and plan on contribute to more open source projects in the future.
