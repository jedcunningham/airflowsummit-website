I am a Data Engineer at QuintoAndar. I graduated in System Analysis and Development and then studied Big Data and Data Management Intelligence at Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo. I started working as a Data Engineer at QuintoAndar, where I discovered Apache Airflow and its vibrant community.

Our data team daily works towards making our data platform better to continue supporting QuintoAndar as a data-driven company. I am passionate about learning and sharing ideas, so I will be glad to talk about data architecture or any Airflow related topics.
