As an engineering manager, I currently support the team in Airbnb that owns Airflow. With the enthusiasm in open source projects, I joined Airbnb to work on the famous Airflow back in 2017 as an engineer. I learned Airflow from brilliant minds, Maxime Beauchemin, Dan Davydov and Alex Guziel, and witnessed the growth of Airflow in Airbnb and in the community. Besides working on interesting engineering problems, I am also a huge fan of video games and motorsports--doing things while sitting is my thing ;)
