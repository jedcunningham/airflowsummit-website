Vanessa is a research software engineer for the Stanford Research Computing Center. She received her PhD in Biomedical Informatics in 2016, and stayed at Stanford to focus on open source software development for scientific reproducibility. Her work includes development of container technologies, workflow software, and recipes for continuous integration. She is passionate about programming and system design, and continues to run the Singularity Hub container registry and maintain a large set of open source libraries. When not programming, Vanessa can be found eating avocados, recording podcast episodes or fun videos, making dinosaur noises, and running outside in the snow.
