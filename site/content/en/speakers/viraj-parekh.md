As a member of the enterprise product team, I focus on helping organizations adopt Apache Airflow on Kubernetes. This includes being the primary sales engineer on pre-sales discussions about the Astronomer platform's capabilities and how it fits into the organizations needs, triaging issues between our roadmap and customer needs with the platform team, and jumping in as Level I or II support. I work with customers across all environments (public clouds and on-prem) and all levels of internal Kubernetes knowledge.

Additionally, I'm actively involved in designing, delivering, and marketing Spacecamp, our training solution designed to accelerate how teams adapt Apache Airflow. I've conducted Airflow trainings in both remote and on-site settings for customers including major financial institutions, top healthcare companies, and tech startups.
