Karolina is a Project Manager at Polidea, a product studio in Warsaw. She currently manages cloud OSS projects that use Apache Airflow and Beam. However, for 5 years she has been involved in working with international clients and teams of different sizes to make their ideas and goals happen. She took care of design and development projects for early stage startups as well as big brands. All done using and experimenting with diverse Agile tools and techniques.

Karolina is an open-minded individual with a strong will for optimisation, out of the box ideas and deep care for communication. Her love for challenges led her to cloud open source projects.
