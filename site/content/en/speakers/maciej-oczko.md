Iâ€™m a CTO at Polidea, a development studio delivering digital products, where I manage and oversee the engineering team. As a big believer in constructive feedback, I foster a culture of growth and learning, and provide leadership in internal projects. I am also involved in the implementation of recruitment and business development strategies that lead to the creation of #UniqueTech.
