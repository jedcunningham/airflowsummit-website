## Why is this an online conference?
Our original purpose was for this to be an onsite event in Mountain View, CA. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to do it entirely online. 

## When will the agenda with confirmed sessions be available?
We expect to publish a first round of confirmed sessions in the first week of June, and the full agenda by June 18th.

## How can I attend the sessions?
The live event will be hosted on the crowdcast platform. In order to register and watch the sessions please visit https://crowdcast.io/e/airflowsummit
