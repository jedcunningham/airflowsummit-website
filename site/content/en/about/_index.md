The first Apache Airflow Summit is here!

The summit will be held in [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) in Mountain View, California, on August 25th-27th, 2020. The 25th of August (Tuesday) is dedicated to training and workshops, and 26th-27th of August (Wednesday-Thursday) is dedicated to talks. 

If you would like to share your experience with other Airflow community members please consider participating in the [Call-For-Papers](https://pretalx.com/apache-airflow-summit-bay-area-2020/cfp). We are planning to have talks about best practices and roadmap, use cases, and About Airflow Community, but all other talks are mostly welcome!

Prior to the conference, on August 25th, we will host workshops for people with little prior knowledge of Airflow to get comfortable writing and debugging their own DAGs. This includes an introduction into the Airflow ecosystem and learning the best practices for writing DAGs. The target audience is Data {Engineers, Scientists, Analysts} with knowledge of Python and eager to dive into Airflow to automate their data pipelines. We will also host workshops for people interested in contributing with code and/or documentation to Apache Airflow.
