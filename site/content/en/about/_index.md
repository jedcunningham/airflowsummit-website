The first Apache Airflow Summit is here!

The summit will be held in [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) in Mountain View, California, 3rd-5th of June, 2020. The 3rd of June (Wednesday) is dedicated to training and workshops, and 4th-5th of June (Thursday-Friday) is dedicated to talks. 

We have just opened a [Call-For-Papers](https://pretalx.com/apache-airflow-summit-bay-area-2020/cfp) process for the Apache Airflow Summit, so please think whether you would like to share your experience with other Airflow community members and make a submission! There is not a lot of time - CFP will last till 8th of March, so be quick about it. We are planning to have talks about best practices and roadmap, use cases, and About Airflow Community, but all other talks are mostly welcome!

Prior to the conference, 3rd of June (Wednesday) will be dedicated to workshops for people with little prior knowledge of Airflow to get comfortable writing and debugging their own DAGs. This includes an introduction into the Airflow ecosystem and learning the best practices for writing DAGs. The target audience is Data {Engineers, Scientists, Analysts} with knowledge of Python and eager to dive into Airflow to automate their data pipelines.

Also there will be workshops for Airflow Users and Airflow Contributors. Check the CFP link for details.
