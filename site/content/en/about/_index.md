The first Apache Airflow Summit is here!

This will be a free online conference held from July 6 to July 17, 2020. 

We are planning to have talks about the Apache Airflow technical roadmap, best practices, use cases, and community. Besides talks, we plan on having in-depth workshops for people with little prior knowledge of Airflow to get comfortable writing and debugging their own DAGs. This includes an introduction into the Airflow ecosystem and learning the best practices for writing DAGs. The target audience is Data {Engineers, Scientists, Analysts} with knowledge of Python and eager to dive into Airflow to automate their data pipelines. We will also have workshops for people interested in contributing with code and/or documentation to Apache Airflow.
