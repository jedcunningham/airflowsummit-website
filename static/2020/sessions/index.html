In order to do this we used the following technologies: Helm to easily deploy Airflow on to Kubernetes; Airflow&rsquo;s Kubernetes Executor to take full advantage Kubernetes features; and Airflow&rsquo;s Kubernetes Pod Operator in order to execute our containerized Tasks within our DAGs. To automate a lot of the deployment process we also used Terraform. Lastly, Kubernetes features were used to gain much more fine grained control of Airflows infrastructure.</p></td>
