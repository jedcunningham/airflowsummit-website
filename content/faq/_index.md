### Where is Airflow Summit?
Airflow Summit 2023 will be at the Marriott Downtown at Eaton Centre in Toronto, Canada. You can find more information about the venue [here](/venue).

### Do I need a visa to travel to Canada?
Many countries donâ€™t need a visa to travel to Canada. Citizens from certain countries (like the USA) just need a valid identity document (like their passport), while citizens from many other countries just require an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), which can be obtained online in minutes and only costs $7 CAD.

### Is there a code of conduct?
Yes. Airflow Summit aims to provide a harrasment-free experience to all participants. Please review our [Code of Conduct](/coc).

### How/when can I get a ticket, how much will they cost?
We plan to open registration/tickets in the second half of March on this website. We expect ticket prices to be between $300 and $450 dollars depending on early bird discount as well as if you will attend for two or three days.

### Will there be live streaming?
We will not have live streaming. We will, however record sessions and make them available later. We are currently evaluating if we simply publish then on the Airflow YouTube or if we host an online event for synced watching of the recordings with live chatting/interaction with speakers and other participants.
