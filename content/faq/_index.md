### Where is Airflow Summit? 
Airflow Summit 2023 will be at the Marriott Downtown at Eaton Centre in Toronto, Canada. You can find more information about the venue [here](/venue).

### Do I need a visa to travel to Canada?

Canada is not only an amazing place for leisure it’s also an awesome place for the tech industry. Besides, it makes reuniting the community way easier since a lot of countries don’t need a visa to travel to Canada, instead you can apply for an eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization). 

Take a look at the detailed info [here.](/canada-visa-process)

### I need to apply for a Canadian visa. Can Airflow Summit issue me a letter confirming my attendance?

Yes, once you have bought your ticket, please request a letter to carolina@sg.com.mx. Please include the following info:
- Full Name
- Passport Number
- Passport Issuing Country
- Role 
- Company

You will receive your letter by email to the email address associated with your ticket.

### Can I get a refund for my ticket if I don't get my visa approved?

Yes, If that happens just send us the info about your visa being rejected and we will issue you a complete refund for your ticket.

Yes. Airflow Summit aims to provide a harassment-free experience to all participants. Please review our [Code of Conduct.](/coc)

### How/when can I get a ticket, how much will they cost?

### Will there be live streaming?

We will not have live streaming. We will, however, record sessions and make them available later.
