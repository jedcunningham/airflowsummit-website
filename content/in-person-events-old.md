While all of the content from Airflow Summit will be live streamed, we will also have multiple in-person events where Airflow users, developers and enthusiasts will gather to watch sessions (either live or in-person) and participate in networking activities.

The following cities/communities are planning to host an in-person event.
1. Amsterdam, Netherlands.
2. Bengaluru, India.
3. Lagos, Nigeria (May 24, 14:30 - 18:30 hrs UTC).
4. London, UK (May 23, 14:30 - 18:30 hrs UTC).
5. Melbourne, Australia.
6. New York City, USA.
7. Paris, France.
8. Sao Paulo, Brasil.
9. Seattle, USA.
10. Tel-Aviv, Israel.
11. Tokyo, Japan.
12. Warsaw, Poland.

The plan is for each of these events to have in-person talks, live streamed talks, networking activities and interaction with local sponsors. 

Each of these events will only take place for one day during the Airflow Summit week. Once we publish the full Airflow Summit program, we will also publish the schedule and details for these in-person events. We will update this page with more details as soon as we have them.

### Other watch-parties
The events mentioned above are the "official" in-person events that we will be supporting from the central organization of Airflow Summit. However, if traveling to any of these cities is not feasible for you and you would like to organize an Airflow Summit watch-party in your city, you are welcome to do so. While we can't commit to supporting your local event, we will gladly add it to a list of watch-parties so that other Airflow enthusiasts in your region are aware of it and attend. Let us know at [info@airflowsummit.org](mailto:info@airflowsummit.org).
