### Permission to travel to Canada
Canada is not only an amazing place for leisure, it’s also an awesome place for the tech industry. Besides, it makes reuniting the community way easier since a lot of countries don’t need a visa to travel to Canada. Citizens from certain countries (like the USA) just need a valid identity document (like their passport), while citizens from most other countries just require an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), which can be obtained online in minutes and only costs $7 CAD.
