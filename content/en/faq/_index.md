## How can I watch the sessions?
Go to the [Live](/live) page (or if you prefer, you can go directly to the crowdcast at https://crowdcast.io/e/airflowsummit). 
* If you are already registered to the Airflow Summit and have an active session on Crowdcast, you should be able to see the live session (or the latest recording if there is none live at the moment).
* If you don't have an active session on the Airflow Summit crowdcast, click on the "Join" button within the crowdcast and follow the instructions.

## Does participation have a cost?
You can watch the live talks for free, you just need to register. Workshops require a separate ticket ($50 USD) and have limited capacity.

## How can I interact with other participants?
We will be in the #airflowsummit-attendees channel of the Apache Airflow community slack. <a href="https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Join here</a>.

## Will sessions be recorded?
All sessions will be recorded. They will be available in two stages with different qualities:
* A few minutes after each session is finished, recordings will be available for viewing directly in Crowdcast. In order to watch a recording of a previous session in Crowdcast, click on the SCHEDULE (upper left corner within the Crowdcast window) and select the session you want. The downside to this recorded version is that it may have "dead time" before the actual start of the talk, plus the audio may not have the best quality.
* At most one week after each talk is performed, we will upload an edited+cleaned version of the recording to the Apache Airflow YouTube channel.

## How can I watch recordings?
While the event is still on course, you can watch recordings from Crowdcast. Simply go to the [Live](/live) page (or open it directly on crowdcast) and within the crowdcast window click on the SCHEDULE text to open a drop down schedule and select a past session you want to watch. The gif below shows where.

## Is there a code of conduct?
Yes. Airflow Summit aims to provide a harrasment-free experience to all participants. Please review our [Code of Conduct](/coc).
