I have been working on Airflow since I joined in Airbnb in 2018. It is also the time when I came to the data world. Before Airbnb, I worked for Citadel to build risk analysis tools, and in Groupon, I was part of the Users Service Team to manage users lifecycle. I am interested in different tech areas, including SOA, infrastructure, data, DevOps.
