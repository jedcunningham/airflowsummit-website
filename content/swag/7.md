Making sense of all your input data isnâ€™t fun, especially when you're consuming inputs from 10s to 1000s of data sources daily. If your data engineering teams are consuming massive amounts of data, across multiple data pipelines, it's nearly impossible to be confident in the quality of your data. Instead of retroactive data monitoring, it's time for more of a proactive approach to ensure better data quality.

In this session we covered:

 * Challenges most code-driven engineers face with input data
 * The five steps to proactive data observability
 * How Databand helps teams observe, monitor, and alert on data in transit
