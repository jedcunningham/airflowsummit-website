Join the participants reception! 

On Tuesday, September 19th, when the program sessions are finalized, we will meet at the foyer for an ice-breaker and fun participantâ€™s reception with some drinks and appetizers. We will also have access to the Par Bar (located upstairs on the event floor) where we will play and show our sporty spirit!
