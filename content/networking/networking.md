Just set up your avatar and get in touch with the Apache Airflow community. You can have a live conversation with other participants, or maybe you simply want to join for playing cards or arcade games. Besides, Google Open Source swag boxes will be raffled between the participants!
See you this Friday, July 9th, at 18:45 UTC (after the last session).
