We will be offering hands-on workshops on how to use or contribute to Apache Airflow. 

* Format & duration: The workshops will be done through Zoom and will have a total duration of 2.5 hours, including small breaks and some time for participants to interact with each other.
* Capacity: At the moment, we are limiting capacity to 25 participants per workshop. We will enable a wait list and see if it is necessary to open more.
* Price: Workshops have a price of $25 USD per person, but we also have scholarships available for those who cannot pay. All proceedings are donated to the Apache Software Foundation.
