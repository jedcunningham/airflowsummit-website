The 2022 edition of Airflow Summit is planned for May 23 to May 27, 2022. It will be a free and online event with blocks of sessions at different times of the day in order to provide live content to attendees in different parts of the world. We will also have a [series of in-person events](/in-person-events) around the world where members of the local Airflow communities will gather to watch sessions and network.
