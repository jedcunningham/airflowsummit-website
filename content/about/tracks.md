summary: "An explanation of the session tracks that we are expecting for this year's event."
---

We have defined different tracks to help you get an idea of contents that would be interesting for the Airflow Summit audience:

* **Trends**. It has been six years since Airflow was invented. In what way are we building data pipelines nowadays? What new and upcoming tools or strategies are you using? 
* **Data governance** (security, privacy, lineage, data quality). How do you manage sensitive data? How to provide observability for downstream users? What is data lineage and how does it relate to Airflow? How do you solve data quality and compliance complexity in your pipelines? 
* **Productionizing machine learning**. How does Airflow fit in the ML workflow? How can you set up automated a/b testing? How do you build and deploy ML models to a production environment? How do you update your model with new features? How do teams of data engineers and scientists collaborate in ML contexts?
* **Airflow internals**. Technical deep dive into how specific components of Airflow work. How to do advanced configuration or hacking Airflow to make it do things it coldn't do before.
* **Airflow in the enterprise**. Talks offer an exploration into business Airflow use cases across industries, ROI, best practices, relevant business metrics, compliance requirements for specific industries, and testimonials.
* **Community**. The Apache way, how and why it works. How to contribute. Non-coding contributions are important too.
* **Open**. Anything else not covered in the other tracks that you think is of interest to this community.
