As we started setting up the [Call for Papers for Airflow Summit 2022](https://sessionize.com/airflow-summit-2022/), one of the organizers had a great idea: Why don’t we share insights from sessions from previous years (what kind of sessions we have had, what has been received best)? So, here it goes!


### Types/focus of sessions

**Use case stories or journeys**. These are highly appreciated, because they show how Airflow is used by organizations “in the real world”: what kind of problems they are solving with Airflow, why they are using it instead of alternatives, how they integrated Airflow within their ecosystem, what challenges they face(d), benefits/advantages accomplished, etcetera. Examples:



* [Airflow at Société Générale](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/airflow-societe-generale/)
* [Pinterest’s migration journey](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/pinterest-migration-journey/)
* [An On-Demand Airflow Service for Internet Scale Gameplay Pipelines (EA)](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/an-on-demand-airflow-service-for-internet-scale-gameplay-pipelines/) 
* [Apache Airflow at Wise](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/apache-airflow-at-wise/)
* [Building the Data Science Platform with Airflow @Near](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/building-ml-pipelines-with-airflow/)
* [Autonomous driving with Airflow (DXC)](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/autonomous-driving-airflow/)
* [Modernize a decade old pipeline with Airflow 2.0 (Scribd)](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/modernize-a-decade-old-pipeline-with-airflow-2.0)
* [Building an Elastic Platform Using Airflow Uniquely as an Orchestrator (QuintoAndar](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/building-an-elastic-platform-using-airflow-orchestrator/))

**Airflow in-depth**. While the best place for technical overview content would be the Airflow official documentation, Airflow Summit always has space for sessions that help explain how Airflow works. These can be either introduction/overview talks, deep dives into a specific aspect or even guides for production or complex scenarios. Examples:



1. [The Newcomer's Guide to Airflow's Architecture](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/guide-airflow-architecture/)
2. [Deep dive in to the Airflow scheduler](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/deep-dive-in-to-the-airflow-scheduler/)
3. [Production Docker image for Apache Airflow](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/production-docker-image/)
4. [Testing Airflow workflows - ensuring your DAGs work before going into production](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/testing-airflow-workflows/)

**Evolving stacks/toolchains**. Another popular type of session involves showing how to use Airflow in combination with other tools (preferably open source). Examples:



* [Building a robust data pipeline with the dAG stack: dbt, Airflow, Great Expectations](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/building-a-robust-data-pipeline-with-the-dag-stack/)
* [The new modern data stack - Airbyte, Airflow, DBT](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/the-new-modern-data-stack-airbyte-airflow-dbt/)
* [Apache Airflow and Ray: Orchestrating ML at Scale](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/airflow-ray/)

**Community & contribution**. Airflow is only possible due to its community. We always welcome sessions that provide guidance and feedback into the Airflow community and how to contribute to the project. Examples:

* [Contributing to Apache Airflow: First Steps](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/contributing-first-steps/)
* [You don’t have to wait for someone to fix it for you](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/dont-have-to-wait/)
* [Adding an executor to Airflow: A contributor overflow exception](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/adding-executor-airflow/)


### Popular sessions

You may also be interested in which sessions the audience liked most. The sessions from Airflow Summit 2021 that were best rated by the audience are:

1. [The Newcomer's Guide to Airflow's Architecture](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/guide-airflow-architecture/)
2. [Creating Data Pipelines with Elyra, a visual DAG composer and Apache Airflow](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/creating-pipelines-elyra/)
3. [Airflow loves Kubernetes](https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/airflow-loves-kubernetes/)


### Selection criteria

All submissions are reviewed by the program committee based on different criteria depending on the type of session.



* Use case/journey: What makes this case interesting? Does it share non-standard scenarios that the community can learn from? 
* Airflow in-depth: Is this a topic/component for which the community needs more content/guidance? Who is the speaker(s) and how well do they know the component/area of Airflow that they will talk about?
* Community: How much will this help us grow and be better as a community?

Content that showcases products or offerings from specific companies is not seen with good eyes, please try to keep your content as vendor-neutral as possible. Note: Open source projects are ok.

While we ask for speaker information in the CFP, you do not need to be a recognized member of the community or have presented in other large conferences. We mostly want to know how your background or context contributes to providing something special for your talk.

Finally, we make our best effort to balance things out and provide a space for speakers and companies from underrepresented backgrounds and regions.


### Conclusion and help

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. We are always open to new ideas for sessions that we couldn’t have thought of before. However, we know that sometimes it is difficult to think of what to talk about, or if your talk is a good fit for an event. We hope that the examples provided here help you get some ideas started.
