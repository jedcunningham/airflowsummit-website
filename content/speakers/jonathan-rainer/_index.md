I’m a software engineer, passionate about solving problems that help people achieve their goals. Over the last few years I’ve worked with Kubernetes, Docker, Java, Python, Rust and many other technologies. In my role at Monzo I work on the Data Platform, which encompasses BigQuery, Airflow and other technologies, to provide insight to our analysts and data scientists in accessing data, quickly, safely and delightfully.
