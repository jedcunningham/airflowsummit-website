I am a Senior Data Engineer at Faire based out of Toronto, Canada. I joined Faire as the second Data Engineer on Core Data Infra team and feel privileged to have witnessed its evolution to this day.



In my free time, I love to play badminton and enjoy hiking and biking outdoors. Been a rusty guitar player who is a big Eric Clapton fan.
