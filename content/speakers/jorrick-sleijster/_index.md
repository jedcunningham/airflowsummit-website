Quite literally, open-source technology is what wakes Jorrick(26) up each morning. During his time at Adyen, he is actively working on deploying and extending open source technologies. His passion for developing in Python made him become active as a contributor to Airflow and has since then made several pull-requests. When he is not working or developing you can find him on the tennis or padel-tennis courts.
