I am a software engineer with over 10 years of experience. Currently I work at Google being part of the team behind Cloud Composer. I have been working using JVM languages most of the time, mainly Java and Scala (Java recently) but I also develop production code in Python. Many of the projects and assignments I have been working on involved working with data using different tools (RTB House: writing data processing pipelines using Pig, Hadoop map/reduce, Spark on advertising and e-commerce data; Elsevier: Amazon Data Pipeline, Spark, Amazon S3 on scientific article publishing data). I have been also part of teams creating data products: machine learning platform neptune.ai and recently orchestrating tool Google Cloud Composer.
