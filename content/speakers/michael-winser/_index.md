He has worked on everything from Internet Explorer and Google Cloud to the kitchen sink (well, kitchen design software). Michael's experience spans over 25 years at Google and Microsoft and more than a decade of startups. Today Michael helps organizations with product strategy, developer ecosystems, open source, and software supply chain security.

When not playing with computers Michael enjoys wing foiling, skating, skiing, and spending time with his family.
