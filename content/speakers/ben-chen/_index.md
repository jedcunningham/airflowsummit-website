As a seasoned data engineer with extensive experience in the field, I'm passionate about open source technology and have dedicated the last seven years to working extensively with Airflow and contributing to the open source community. Currently, I serve as a Data Engineering Manager at Vestiaire Collective, a leading online marketplace for pre-owned luxury fashion, where my team and I specialize in data platforming and MLOps. 



Our focus is on designing and implementing scalable data architectures that support the company's growth. Specifically, we build and maintain the data infrastructure needed for ETL processes and machine learning models to operate effectively. 

By leveraging cutting-edge tools such as Airflow, we've been able to optimize workflows and enhance the customer experience, which has driven business growth in the process. I'm deeply committed to using technology to solve complex business problems and to drive innovation within the fashion industry.
