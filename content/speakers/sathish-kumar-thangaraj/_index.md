I'm a Frontend developer driven by enthusiasm and passion for crafting software.With over 15 of hands-on experience in web development, I have a deep understanding of modern frontend technologies and frameworks. I actively explore Kubernetes concepts, experiment with containerization techniques, and seek opportunities to apply cloud-native principles to frontend development
