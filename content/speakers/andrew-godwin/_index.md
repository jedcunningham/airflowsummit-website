Andrew works full-time on Airflow as a Principal Engineer at Astronomer, and has almost two decades of history with Python and open-source software, including a decade of contributions to the Django framework.

He lives in Denver, USA, and in his spare time enjoys flying light aircraft, hiking up or sliding down mountains, and building all manner of odd contraptions in his workshop.
