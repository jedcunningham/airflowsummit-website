I am a Senior Customer Success Manager at Astronomer. I am passionate about open-source projects and lucky to have the opportunity to work at Astronomer and help our customers achieve their goals by leveraging Airflow



In my free time, I love to do DIY home renovation projects, work on my garden and spend as much time outdoors as possible! I love to cook and feeding people fills my soul.
