I have eight years of experience as a software engineer. Presently, I hold the position of lead engineer at the Robinhood Workflow Infrastructure team. Prior to this role, I was engaged in application backend development at Amazon's consumer payments team. In my current capacity, I am tasked with the upkeep and scalability of Robinhood's workflow infrastructure, ensuring its reliability and efficiency.
