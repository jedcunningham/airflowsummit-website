Experienced technology leader, change agent and dev-culture architect. I lead with humility and empathy, helping organizations thrive by the collective strengths of their peopleâ€™s superpowers. I believe in building diverse and thought-inclusive engineering teams that embody ownership and commitment to purpose.
