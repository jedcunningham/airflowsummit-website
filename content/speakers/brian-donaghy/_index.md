My 20 years of experience as an engineer have mostly been in the software and systems design of imaging, targeting and navigation systems in the aerospace industry. In recent years I've been applying my experience with implementing statistical and machine learning models in embedded systems to a mix of cloud and edge computing solutions. As a consultant, my current focus is delivering turn-key solutions to clients, eschewing the silos of data science, machine learning engineering, data engineering and data analytics.
