Siraj Malik is an Engineering Manager for the Data Science Platform team at Sony PlayStation. Originally 5 years ago, Siraj started as an Engineer at PlayStation working on the migration of the Data Science tooling capabilities to AWS and at that time introduced Airflow to the organization and gained adoption for its use. Since then, Siraj has worked with the broader team to evolve and ensure that the Airflow deployment and usage within the organization remains at the edge, taking advantage of the latest Airflow features. Like many at PlayStation, Siraj likes to play video games in his spare time.
