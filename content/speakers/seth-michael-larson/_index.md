Hey there! My name is Seth, and I am the Security Developer-in-Residence at the Python Software Foundation and working on improving the security posture of projects like CPython, PyPI, and the broader Python ecosystem.

I maintain and contribute to multiple open source projects. Most notably I'm the lead maintainer of urllib3, an HTTP client library that is the most downloaded package on the Python Package Index. I was made a Python Software Foundation Fellow in 2022.

I enjoy writing about Python, open source maintenance and sustainability, security, and technology powering the internet. If you're also interested in these topics you may find articles on my blog worth a read.
