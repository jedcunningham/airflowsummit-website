I began my data career nearly two decades ago and, since then, have worn numerous hats in the realms of Analytics/BI, Data Science and, most recently, Data Engineering. Having experienced the data world from a variety of perspectives, I've developed a passion for empowering organizations and data professionals to take full advantage of the rich tools at their disposals. When I first encountered Airflow and its ability to implement highly flexible workflows programmatically, it was a revelation in this regard. It's become a key technology that I champion whenever the need to orchestrate data movement and transformation arises. Similarly, I'm an advocate for taking full advantage of cloud technologies, especially serverless, and am both AWS and GCP certified.
