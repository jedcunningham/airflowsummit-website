CJ is an engineering manager at Monte Carlo Data with 13 years of experience up and down the data stack. He started as a data analyst in biotech before joining Pivotal and Greenplum database, building parallelized relational databases. He then worked on natural-language processing at Tableau for analytics visualizations.

Now at Monte Carlo Data, he specializes in the integrations and end-to-end coverage of Data Observability for the modern data stack, focused on Airflow as a key job orchestrator that data engineers have as their mental model of their data.

Ask him about his hot take about why he prefers "angled lines" in dags rather than "curvy lines".
