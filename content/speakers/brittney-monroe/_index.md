Brittney has a vast and varied history within the data realm; including experience as a data analyst, a database administrator, and the last few years, a data engineer. She is incredibly passionate about data governance and validation solutions, and the best way to implement both in tandem within data systems. Brittney is currently deeply interested in learning further best practices around MLOps and how to bridge the gap between data science and data engineering.
