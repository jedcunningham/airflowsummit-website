My name is Michael Kotliar. I am a Senior Applications Analyst at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. My area of expertise is mainly focused on epigenomics research data analysis. However, I’m also passionate about software development, workflow management systems, robotics, and automation. I’m a constant learner and believe that knowledge across and beyond different disciplines is the key to the biggest achievements and discoveries. A huge fan of Star Wars, a hiker, a cyclist, and an outdoorsy person.
