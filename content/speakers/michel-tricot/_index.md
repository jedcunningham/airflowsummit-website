Michel has been working in data engineering for the past 15 years. More recently, as head of integrations and director of engineering at Liveramp (NYSE: RAMP), he grew the team responsible for building and scaling the data ingestion and data distribution connectors, syncing 100s TB every day. In 2020, he co-founded Airbyte, the new open-source data integration platform with the vision to commoditize data integration pipelines across all industries and organizations. After just 5 months, Airbyte raised $5.2M from Accel, YCombinator, 8VC, and some high-profile business angels, including the co-founder of Segment, the former GM of Cloudera, and the co-founder of Liveramp and Safegraph.
