I'm a data industry professional with a teaching background and experience as both an engineer and analyst in quickly growing business environments. I'm experienced with building and scaling ETL, DS/ML, analytics and reporting stacks that process terabytes of data and are used by hundreds of individuals. I thrive in a role where I'm building processes, platforms and tools that empower people to fetch and analyze their own data.
