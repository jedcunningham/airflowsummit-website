I am a B.Sc. Computer Technology graduate [26 years] and I am an open source contributor at the Apache Airflow project and the Founder of Acies Crest. My vision for Acies Crest is to provide data analytics tools to underserved regions who have limited resources. Creating optimized data infrastructure that supports analytics processes at scale is effective at addressing challenges such as inefficiencies that arise due to resource constraints.
