 I love being tasked with a complex problem and designing and implementing solutions to solve them. I'm technically focused, an individual contributor at heart, but also manage a data engineering team. I administer Airflow clusters that various teams use, and strive to work with the business side to understand how Airflow can be used to simplify everyone else's lives.
