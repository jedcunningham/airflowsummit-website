Hi, my name is Stanislav, and I am a data engineer with 2 years of experience in the field. I have a strong passion for all things data-related, and I am committed to designing and implementing efficient and accurate data solutions that meet the needs of clients and stakeholders.

Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in a range of technologies and tools, including SQL, Python, Airflow, K8s and Google Cloud Platform. I am always eager to learn about new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in data engineering.

As a data engineer, I take pride in my ability to design and implement complex data pipelines that process and store large amounts of information while maintaining data integrity and security. I am a strong team player and thrive in collaborative environments where I can leverage my communication skills to work effectively with other members of the team.

When I'm not working, I enjoy squash, volleyball and I love to hang out with friends.
