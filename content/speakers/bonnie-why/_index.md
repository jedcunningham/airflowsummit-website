Bonnie Why loves to ask ""why"". Despite not having a formal degree, my habit of asking excellent questions and always searching for the tough stuff has led me to my role as a Data Engineer at Burns & McDonnell. I seek to not only find the patterns, but create them. Unit tests are king, change my mind.

In my free time, I enjoy coming up with endless nicknames for my dog, playing way too many video games, and perpetually refactoring my Notion setup.
