In Airflow 2.3 the ability to change the number of tasks dynamically opens up some exciting new ways of building DAGs and lets us create new patterns that just weren't possible before.

In this session I will cover a little bit about AIP-42 and the interface for Dynamic Task Mapping, and cover some common use cases and patterns.
