This session is about the state and future plans of the multi-tenancy feature of Airlfow.
 
Airflow has traditionally been single-tenant product. Mutliple instances could be bound together to provide a multi-tenant implementation and when using a modern infrastructure - Kubernetes - you could even reuse resources between those - but it was not a true "multi-tenant" solution.
 
But Airflow becomes more of a platform now and the needs for multi-tenancy as a feature of the platform are highly expected by a number of users.
 
In 2022 we've started to add mutli-tenant features and we are aiming to make Airflow Multi-Tenant in the near* future. 
 
This talk is about the state of the multi-tenancy now and the future plans we have for Airlfow becoming full multi-tenant platform.
