According to analysts, 87 percent of enterprises have already adopted hybrid cloud strategies (https://www.flexera.com/blog/industry-trends/trend-of-cloud-computing-2020/). Customers have many reasons why they need to support hybrid environments, from maximising the value from heritage systems, to meeting local compliance and data processing regulations. As they build their data pipelines, they increasingly need to be able to orchestrate those across on-premesis and cloud environments. In this session, I will share how you can leverage Apache Airflow to orchestrate a workflow using data sources inside and outside the cloud.
