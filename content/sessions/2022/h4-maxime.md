This talk tells the story of how we have approached data and analytics as a startup at Preset and how the need for a data orchestrator grew over time. Our stack is (loosely) Fivetran/Segment/dbt/BigQuery/Hightouch, and we finally got to a place where we suffer quite a bit from *not* having an orchestrator and are bringing in Airflow to address our orchestration needs. This talk is about how startups approach solving data challenges, the shifting role of the orchestrator in the modern data stack, and the growing need for an orchestrator as your data platform becomes more complex.
