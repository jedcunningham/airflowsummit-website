Have you faced a scenario where 100 worker slots are available to run the Tasks, but you have 100 DAGs waiting on a Sensor thatâ€™s currently running but idle, waiting for something to happen? Ultimately, you got frustrated as you could not run anything else - even though your entire Airflow cluster was essentially idle. This is exactly where the concept of Deferrable Operators is very useful. 

This talk aims to give a brief introduction to solving this problem using Deferrable or Async Operators and how to implement it for your use case.
  
This talk also aims to explain: 
  * Introduction to deferrable operator
  * Introduction to Triggers
  * Using deferrable operator - real-world use case
  * Writing deferrable operators
  * Triggering deferral
  * Writing Triggers
  * Example of deferrable S3 Operator
  * Advantages over Smart Sensors and reschedule mode for sensor
  * Guide to implement your deferrable operator with astronomer-providers repository as an example to start with
  * References for useful concepts and libraries: Concurrency, Python asyncio
