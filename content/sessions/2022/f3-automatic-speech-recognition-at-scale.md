Automatic Speech Recognition is quite a compute intensive task, which depends on complex Deep Learning models. To do this at scale, we leveraged the power of Tensorflow, Kubernetes and Airflow.
 
In this session, you will learn about our journey to tackle this problem, main challenges, and how Airflow made it possible to create a solution that is powerful, yet simple and flexible.
