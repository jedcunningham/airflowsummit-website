The task logging subsystem is one of most flexible, yet complex and misunderstood components of Airflow.
 
 
 
 In this talk, we will take a look at the various task log handlers that are part of the core Airflow distribution, and dig a bit deeper in the interfaces they implement and discuss how those can be used to roll your own logging implementation.
