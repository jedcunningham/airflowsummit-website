“Why is my data missing?” “Why didn’t my Airflow job run?” “What happened to this report?” If you’ve been on the receiving end of any of these questions, you’re not alone. As data pipelines become increasingly complex and companies ingest more and more data, data engineers are on the hook for troubleshooting where, why, and how data quality issues occur, and most importantly, fixing them so systems can get up and running again. In this talk, Lior Gavish, CTO and co-founder of Monte Carlo, discusses the three primary factors that contribute to data quality issues and how data teams can leverage Airflow, dbt, and other solutions in their arsenal to conduct root cause analysis on their data pipelines.
