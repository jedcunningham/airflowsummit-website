Organizations need to effectively manage large volumes of complex, business-critical workloads across multiple applications and platforms. Choosing the right workflow orchestration tool is important as it can help teams effectively automate the configuration, coordination, integration, and data management processes on several applications and systems. Currently there are a lot of tools (both open sourced and proprietary) available for orchestrating tasks and data workflows with automation features. Each of them claim to focus on ensuring a centralized, repeatable, reproducible, and efficient workflows coordination. Choosing one among them is an arduous task as it requires an in-depth understanding of the capabilities that these tools have to offer that translate to your specific engineering needs.
 
  
 
 Apache Airflow which is a powerful and widely-used open-source workflow management system (WMS) designed to programmatically author, schedule, orchestrate, and monitor data pipelines and workflows. In this talk, understand how Apache Airflow compares with other popular orchestration tools in-terms of architecture, scalability, management, observability, automation, native features, cost, available integrations and more. Get a head-to-head comparison of whatâ€™s possible as we dissect capabilities of the tools against the other. This comparative analysis will help you in your decision making process, whether you are planning to migrate an existing system or evaluating for your first enterprise orchestration platform.
