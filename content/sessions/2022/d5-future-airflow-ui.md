Sneak peek at the future of the Airflow UI. In Airflow 2.3 with the Tree -> Grid view changes, we began to swap out parts of the Flask app with React. This was one step towards AIP-38, to build a fully modern UI for Airflow. Come check out what is in store after Grid view in the current UI.
  
Discuss the possibilities to rethink Airflow with a brand new UI down the line. Such as:
  * Integrating all DAG visualizations into each other and remove constant page reloads 
  * More live data
  * Greater cross-DAG visualizations (ie: DAG Dependencies view from 2.1)
  * Improved user settings: (dark mode, color blind support, language, date format)
  * And more!
