In this talk, I am going to share things that I learned while contributing to Apache Airflow. I am an Outreachy Intern for Apache Airflow. I made my first contribution to Open Source in the Apache Airflow project. I will also add a short description about myself and my experience working in Software Engineering and How i needed help in contributing to Open Source and ended up as an Intern for Outreachy. I also like to share about my first contribution towards Apache Airflow in its doc and how much confidence it gave me to continue contributing to it.
 
 
 
 Key things that I learned when contributing to Apache Airflow are:
 
 * Clear communication in written form is very powerful - 
 
 There are many times when I went back to the comments in PR/issues and gain more understanding out of it. Also, there are times when I started writing technical details as comments and watched how my thought process became clear and when putting it down as words I had a greater understanding. This motivated me to write blogs and I am happy about how it is shaping up too
 
 
 
 * Code is not an asset and don’t worry about throwing it away - 
 
 Initially when I worked on a few issues, I worked for 3 days on it and chucked it at the end as I found an easy way to do it. I felt I wasted my time. But I later realized that experience of working deep on an issue helped to find a simple way to solve it. If not for those 3 days, I wouldn’t have found the easy way to solve it. 
 
 
 
 * Don’t feel shy about asking questions - Asking simple questions is not a bad idea. It actually did more good to me. One of my co-intern Edith asked the question that I was hesitating to ask. The question is about Git rebase and I am very glad she did it. It would take me at least few days to understand about git rebase as I was mostly using git merge before. I got good help from my mentor and the story didn’t end. They came up with an awesome idea of enabling the Rebase branch feature in Github and it turned out to be so useful.
 
  
 
 * Open Source is a rich ecosystem where each projects help each other and thrive. 
 
 Quote example about Python click project and about weakdict issue raised in Airflow Slack channel to tell how each projects are interdependent on other.
 
 
 
 * Trivial things became no more trivial to me - My mentor emphasized putting color codes on user questions or showing warning messages. At first, it looked trivial to me, but I realized it’s importance when I was struck with same issue where i spent long time without properly reading the warning message. It made me realise that code is not meant to simply run / follow logical order, it’s more about keeping it clear, show proper (warning/error/info) messages. That way it would be helpful to others.
 
 
 
 While the above things are overall learning about open source contribution,
 
 
 
 I had specific important learnings for me which include writing unit tests, got to communicate with developers across the globe, improved written style of communication, knowing about many python libraries, understanding the CI pipeline.
