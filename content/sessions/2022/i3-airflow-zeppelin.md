Airflow is the almost de-facto standard job orchestration tool that is used in the production stage. But moving your job from the development stage in other tools to the production stage in Airflow is usually a big pain for lots of users. A major reason is due to the environment inconsistency between the development environment and the production environment. Apache Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that is integrated seamlessly with lots of popular big data engines, such as Spark, Flink, Hive, Presto and etc. So it is very suitable for the development stage. 
 
In this talk, I will talk about the seamless integration between Airflow & Zeppelin, so that you can develop your big data job in Zeppelin efficiently and move to Airflow easily without caring too much about issues caused by the environment inconsistency.
