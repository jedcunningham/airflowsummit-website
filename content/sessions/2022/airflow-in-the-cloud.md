Airflow users love to run Airflow in public clouds and on distributed infrastructures like Kubernetes. Running Airflow environments is easier than ever - community offers Helm-based installation for self-managed Airflow and there are many offerings of Airflow-based managed services. 
 
Commoditization of Airflow and broader Airflow user base brings new challenges. This talk presents observations of the Airflow service provider delivering "Airflow as a Service'' to cloud users (very technical, less technical and not technical at all). Information presented during this talk will be directed to the Apache Airflow committers and contributors with the hope that one can influence Airflow's future roadmap so that Apache Airflow becomes easy to use.
