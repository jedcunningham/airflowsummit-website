Your team just migrated to a data mesh (or so they think). Your CTO is all in on this “modern data stack,” or as she calls it: “The Enterprise Data Discovery.” To satisfy your company’s insatiable appetite for data, you may even be building a complex, multi-layered data ecosystem: in other words, a data platform. Still, it’s one thing to build a data platform, but how do you ensure it actually drives value for your business? In this fireside chat, Barr Moses, CEO & co-founder of Monte Carlo, will walk through why best in class data teams are treating their data platforms like product software and how to get started with reliability and scale in mind.
