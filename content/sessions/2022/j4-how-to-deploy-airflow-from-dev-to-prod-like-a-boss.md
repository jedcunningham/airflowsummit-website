Managing Airflow in large-scale environments is tough. You know this, and I know this. 
 
But, what if you had a guide to make development, testing, and production lifecycles more manageable? 
 
In this presentation, I will share how we manage Airflow for large-scale environments with friendly deployments at every step.
 
After attending the session, Airflow engineers will: 
  * Understand the advantages of each kind of deployment 
  * Know the differences between Deployment and Airflow Executor
  * Deploy how to incorporate all kinds of deployments for their day-to-day needs
