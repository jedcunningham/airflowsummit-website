In this talk, we explain how Apache Airflow is at the center of our Kubernetes-based Data Science Platform at PlayStation. We talk about how we built a flexible development environment for Data Scientists to interact with Apache Airflow and explain the tools and processes we built to help Data Scientists promote their dags from development to production. 
 
We will also talk about the impact of containerization and the usage of KubernetesOperator and the new SparkKubernetesOperator and the benefits of deploying Airflow in Kubernetes using the KubernetesExecutor across multiple environments.
