Machine Learning models can add value and insight to many projects, but they can be challenging to put into production due to problems like lack of reproducibility, difficulty maintaining integrations, and sneaky data quality issues. Kedro, a framework for creating reproducible, maintainable, and modular data science code, and Great Expectations, a framework for data validations, are two great open-source Python tools that can address some of these problems. Both integrate seamlessly with Airflow for flexible and powerful ML pipeline orchestration. In this talk we'll discuss how you can leverage existing Airflow provider packages to integrate these tools to create sustainable, production-ready ML models.
