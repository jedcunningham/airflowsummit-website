Apache Superset is a modern, open-source data exploration & visualization platform originally created by Maxime Beauchemin. In this talk, I will showcase advanced technical Superset features like the rich Superset API, how to version control dashboards using Github, embedding Superset charts in other applications, and more. This talk will be technical and hands-on, and I will share all code examples I use so you can play with them yourself afterwards!
