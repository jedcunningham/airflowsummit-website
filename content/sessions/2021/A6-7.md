Airflow 2.0 was a big milestone for the Airflow community. However, companies and enterprises are still facing difficulties in upgrading to 2.0. 
 
In this talk, I would like to focus and highlight the ideal upgrade path and talk about 
 
 - upgrade_check CLI tool
 - separation of providers
 - registering connections types
 - important 2.0 Airflow configs
 - DB Migration
 - deprecated feature around Airflow Plugins
