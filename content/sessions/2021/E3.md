In this talk, I’ll describe how you can leverage 3 open-source standards - workflow management with Airflow, EL with Airbyte, transformation with DBT - to build your next modern data stack. I’ll explain how to configure your Airflow DAG to trigger Airbyte’s data replication jobs and DBT’s transformation one with a concrete use case.
