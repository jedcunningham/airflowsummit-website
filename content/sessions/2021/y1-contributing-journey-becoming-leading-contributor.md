From not knowing Python (let alone Airflow), and from submitting the first PR that fixes typo to becoming Airflow Committer, PMC Member, Release Manager, and #1 Committer this year, this talk walks through Kaxil's journey in the Airflow World.
 
 The second part of this talk explains:
 - how you can also start your OSS journey by contributing to Airflow 
 - Expanding familiarity with a different part of the Airflow codebase
 - Continue committing regularly & steadily to become Airflow Committer. (including talking about current Guidelines of becoming a Committer)
 - Different mediums of communication (Dev list, users list, Slack channel, Github Discussions etc)
