In this talk, we present Viewflow, an open-source Airflow-based framework that allows data scientists to create materialized views in SQL, R, and Python without writing Airflow code.

 We will start by explaining what problem does Viewflow solve: writing and maintaining complex Airflow code instead of focusing on data science. Then we will see how Viewflow solves that problem. We will continue by showing how to use VIewflow with several real-world examples. Finally, we will see what the upcoming features of Viewflow are!
