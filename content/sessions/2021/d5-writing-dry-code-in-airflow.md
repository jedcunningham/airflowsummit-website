Engineering teams leverage the factory coding pattern to write easy-to-read and repeatable code. In this talk, weâ€™ll outline how data engineering teams can do the same with Airflow by separating DAG declarations from business logic, abstracting task declarations from task dependencies, and creating a code architecture that is simple to understand for new team members. This approach will set analytics teams up for success as team and Airflow DAG sizes grow exponentially.
