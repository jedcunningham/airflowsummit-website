We will talk about
- Our first tryst with understanding Airflow
- Talking to Amazon Data Engineers and how they ran workflows at scale

- Road ahead, and what we dream about for future of Apache Airflow.
- Open-Source tenets and commitment from the team

We will leave time at the end for a short AMA/Questions.
