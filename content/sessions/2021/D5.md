Wise (previously TransferWise) is a London-based fin-tech company. We build a better way of sending money internationally.
 
 At Wise we make great use of Airflow. More than 100 data scientists, analysts and engineers use Airflow every day to generate reports, prepare data, (re)train machine learning models and monitor services.
 
 My name is Alexandra, I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Wise. Our team is responsible for building and maintaining Wise’s Airflow instances. In this presentation I would like to talk about three main things, our current setup, our challenges and our future plans with Airflow. We are currently transitioning from a single centralised Airflow instance into many segregated instances to increase reliability and limit access. We’ve learned a lot throughout this journey and looking to share these learnings with a wider audience.
