This presentation will detail how Elyra creates Jupyter Notebook, Python and R script- based pipelines without having to leave your web browser.
 The goal of using Elyra is to help construct data pipelines by surfacing concepts and patterns common in pipeline construction into a familiar, easy to navigate interface for Data Scientists and Engineers so they can create pipelines on their own. In Elyra’s Pipeline Editor UI, portions of Apache Airflow’s domain language are surfaced to the user and either made transparent or understandable through the use of tooltips or helpful notes in the proper context during pipeline construction. With these features, Elyra can rapidly prototype data workflows without the need to know or write any pipeline code.
 Lastly, we will look at what features we have planned on our roadmap for Airflow, including more robust Kubernetes integration and support for runtime specific components/operators.
