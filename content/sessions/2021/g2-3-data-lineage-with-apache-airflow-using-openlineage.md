If you manage a lot of data, and you're attending this summit, you likely rely on Apache Airflow to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Like any powerful tool, Apache Airflow allows you to accomplish what you couldn't beforeâ€¦ but also creates new challenges. As DAGs pile up, complexity layers on top of complexity and it becomes hard to grasp how a failed or delayed DAG will affect everything downstream.
 In this session we will provide a crash course on OpenLineage, an open platform for metadata management and data lineage analysis. We'll show how capturing metadata with OpenLineage can help you maintain inter-DAG dependencies, capture data on historical runs, and minimize data quality issues.
