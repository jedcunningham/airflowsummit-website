At Near we work on TBs of Location data with close to real time modelling to generate key consumer insights and estimates for our clients across the globe. We have hundreds of country specific models deployed and managed through airflow to achieve this goal. Some of the workflows that we have deployed our schedule based, some are dynamic and some are trigger based. In this session I would be discussing some of the workflows that are being scheduled and monitored using airflow and the key benefits and also the challenges that we have faced in our production systems.
