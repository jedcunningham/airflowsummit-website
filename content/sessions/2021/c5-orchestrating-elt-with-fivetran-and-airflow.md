At Fivetran, we are seeing many organizations adopt the Modern Data Stack to suit the breadth of their data needs. However, as incoming data sources begin to scale, it can be hard to manage and maintain the environment, with more time spent repairing and reengineering old data pipelines than building new ones. This talk will introduce a number of new Airflow Providers, including the airflow-provider-fivetran, and discuss some of the benefits and considerations we are seeing data engineers, data analysts, and data scientist experience in doing so.
