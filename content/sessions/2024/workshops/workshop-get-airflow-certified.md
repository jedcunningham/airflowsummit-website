As an Airflow Summit attendee, weâ€™re thrilled to offer you an in-person opportunity to take an [Airflow Certification](https://www.astronomer.io/certification/) exam at no additional cost. Depending on your skill level, you can take one of two exams:
 - Apache Airflow Fundamentals
 - DAG Authoring for Apache Airflow (Advanced)

The Airflow Fundamentals exam tests for core Airflow concepts. This includes DAGs, tasks, operators, scheduling, and basic DAG-writing best practices. The DAG Authoring exam tests for advanced Airflow functionality such as dynamic tasks, TaskFlow API, and templating. Both exams contain 75 multiple-choice questions that you must complete in 60 minutes. To pass, you must answer 70% of the questions correctly.

The workshop will include 20 mins of preparation and a Q&A with Marc Lamberti from Astronomer. Then, you will take the exam in the room with your own laptop. You may not use a mobile device.

You will receive your result in real time and a badge shortly after. All attendees who pass will receive an exclusive gift from the conference. Attendees who score 100% on the exam will receive an additional prize. We know you can do it!
