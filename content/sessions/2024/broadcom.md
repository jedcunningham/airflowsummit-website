Airflow’s “workflow as code” approach has many benefits, including enabling dynamic pipeline generation and flexibility and extensibility in a seamless development environment. However, what challenges do you face as you expand your Airflow footprint in your organization? What if you could enhance Airflow's monitoring capabilities, forecast DAG and task executions, obtain predictive alerting, visualize trends, and get more robust logging?

Broadcom’s Automation Analytics & Intelligence (AAI) offers advanced analytics for workload automation for cloud and on-premises automation. It connects easily with Airflow to offer improved visibility into dependencies between tasks in Airflow DAGs along with the workload’s critical path, dynamic SLA management, and more.

Join our presentation to hear more about how AAI can help you improve service delivery. We will also lead a workshop that will allow you to dive deeper into how easy it is to install our Airflow Connector and get started visualizing your Airflow DAGs to optimize your workload and identify issues before they impact your business.
