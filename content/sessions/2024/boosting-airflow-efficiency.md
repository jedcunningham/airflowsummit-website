In the world of managing data & ETL workflows, Apache Airflow is a crucial tool for automating tasks. However, getting the most out of it requires more than just a basic setup. In this article, we take a deep dive into the details of Airflow performance improvement, focusing on how itâ€™s set up and configured. Through deep dive analysis, we uncover the details that can greatly improve how DAG tasks are carried out and how the Airflow scheduler performs. By optimizing & tuning the airflow environment adjustments to Airflow Environmental Configuration settings & DAG level changes, we unleash the full power of Airflow, making workflows more productive and reliable. Join us as we uncover the secrets to orchestrating tasks with accuracy and next-level achievements.

Airflow provides the custom ability to tune the performance of instance. We can modify environment-level settings or DAG-level changes to tune performance across all of the DAGs in your Airflow environment. In this session, we are going deep into airflow performance optimization through performance tuning & configuration along with Top Level Python code removal
