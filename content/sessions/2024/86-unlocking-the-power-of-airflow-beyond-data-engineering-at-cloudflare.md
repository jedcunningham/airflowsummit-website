While Airflow is widely known for orchestrating and managing workflows, particularly in the context of data engineering, data science, ML (Machine Learning), and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, its flexibility and extensibility make it a highly versatile tool suitable for a variety of use cases beyond these domains. In fact, Cloudflare has publicly shared in the past an example on how Airflow was leveraged to build a system that automates datacenter expansions.
 
 
 
 In this talk, I will share a few more of our use cases beyond traditional data engineering, demonstrating Airflow's sophisticated capabilities for orchestrating a wide variety of complex workflows, and discussing how Airflow played a crucial role in building some of the highly successful autonomous systems at Cloudflare, from handling automated bare metal server diagnostics and recovery at scale, to Zero Touch Provisioning that is helping us accelerate the roll out of inference-optimized GPUs in 150+ cities in multiple countries globally.
