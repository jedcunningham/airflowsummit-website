Ready to make your first contribution to Apache Airflow? Join us in this hands-on workshop where we'll walk you through the first steps of your first Airflow contribution. We’ll start with the basics, showing you how to set up your development environment (although it’s strongly recommended to have Breeze already installed) and find issues that match your skills. You’ll learn how to navigate the contribution process, from creating your first pull request to understanding how to get feedback from the community. Whether you want to write code, improve documentation, or provide feedback, there’s a place for everyone. Let's get started and see your name on the list of Airflow contributors!
