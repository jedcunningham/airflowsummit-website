NerdWallet's multi-tenant Airflow setup faced challenges such as slow DAG processing, which resulted in underutilized Snowflake warehouses and elevated costs. Although our transition to Airflow 2 may have been delayed, we recognize that many other teams are also working to get buy-in and resources for their migration efforts. We hope that our story on how unlocking the scheduling capabilities of Airflow 2 helped us reduce our Snowflake spend by half can get you the buy in you need.

The session will cover our comprehensive strategies, the technical challenges we overcame, and how Airflow 2's features have enabled more efficient operations and cost savings at scale.
