OpenLineage is an open standard for lineage data collection, integrated into the Airflow codebase, facilitating lineage collection across providers like Google, Amazon, and more.
 
 
 
 Atlan Data Catalog is a 3rd generation active metadata platform that is a single source of trust unifying cataloging, data discovery, lineage, and governance experience.
 
 
 
 We will demonstrate what OpenLineage is and how, with minimal and intuitive setup across Airlfow and Atlan, it presents unified workflows view, efficient cross-platform lineage collection, including column level, in various technologies (Python, Spark, dbt, SQL etc.) and clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) - all orchestrated by Airflow.
 
 
 
 This integration enables further use case unlocks on automated metadata management by making the operational pipelines dataset-aware for self-service exploration. It also will demonstrate real world challenges and resolutions for lineage consumers in improving audit and compliance accuracy through column-level lineage traceability across the data estate.
 
 
 
 The talk will also briefly overview the most recent OpenLineage developments and planned future enhancements.
