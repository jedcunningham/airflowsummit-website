In the last few years Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen to prominence as outstanding tools capable of transforming businesses. However, bringing such solutions and models to the business-as-usual operations is not an easy task. In this session, we delve into the operationalization of generative AI applications using MLOps principles, leading to the introduction of foundation model operations (FMOps) or LLM operations using Apache Airflow. We further zoom into aspects of expected people and process mindsets, new techniques for model selection and evaluation, data privacy, and model deployment. Additionally, know how you can use the prescriptive features of Apache Airflow to aid your operational journey. Whether you are building using out of the box models (open-source or proprietary), creating new foundation models from scratch, or fine-tuning an existing model, with the structured approaches described you can effectively integrate LLMs into your operations, enhancing efficiency and productivity without causing disruptions in the cloud or on-premises.
