 With Airflow’s mainstream acceptance in the enterprise, the operational challenges of running with applications in production have emerged.
 
 At last year’s Airflow Summit in Toronto, three providers of Apache Airflow met to discuss “The Future of Airflow: What Users Want”. Among the user requirements in the session were:
 
  * An improved security model allowing “Alice” and “Bob” to run their single DAGs without each requiring a separate Airflow cluster, while still adhering to their organization’s compliance requirements.
 
  * An “Orchestrator of Orchestrators” relationship in which Airflow oversees the myriad orchestrators embedded in many tools and provided by cloud vendors.
 
 
 
 That panel discussion described what Airflow users now understand to be mandatory for their workloads in enterprise production, and defined the exact operational requirements our customers have successfully tackled for decades. 
 
 
 
 Join us in this session to learn how Control-M’s Airflow integration helps data engineers do what they need to do with Airflow and gives IT Ops the key to deliver enterprise business application results in production.
