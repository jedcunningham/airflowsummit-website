Feeling trapped in a maze of duplicate Airflow DAG code? We were too! That's why we embarked on a journey to build a centralized library, eliminating redundancy and unlocking delightful efficiency.

Join us as we share:
* The struggles of managing repetitive code across DAGs
* Our approach to a centralized library, revealing design and implementation strategies
* The amazing results: reduced development time, clean code, effortless maintenance, and a framework that creates efficient and self-documenting DAGs

Let's break free from complexity and duplication, and build a brighter Airflow future together!
