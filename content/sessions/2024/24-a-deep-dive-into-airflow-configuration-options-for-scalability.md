Apache Airflow has a lot of configuration options. A change in some of these options can affect the performance of Airflow.
 
 
 
 If you are wondering why your Airflow instance is not running the number of tasks you expected it to run, after this talk, you will have a better understanding of the configuration options available for improving the number of tasks your Airflow instance can run.
 
 
 
 We will talk about the DAG parsing configuration options, options for scheduler scalability, etc., and the pros and cons of these options.
