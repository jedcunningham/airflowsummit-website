At Wix, we've traversed the intricate landscape of Apache Airflow, a platform that serves as the backbone for orchestrating our data workflows. In our journey, we've encountered many challenges and insights regarding the relationship between Apache Airflow developers, DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) authors, business analysts and of course, the backend platform team who maintained the deployments. This talk aims to delve deep into this dynamic interplay, shedding light on how we've managed to support a vast user base of 150 Data Engineers while maintaining efficiency and coherence in our Airflow deployments.

In this talk, We'll explore the roles and responsibilities of Apache Airflow DEs, DAG authors, maintainers, and how they collaborate. We'll discuss the criteria we use to determine when standardization is necessary and when flexibility is paramount. 
We'll reflect on our journey, highlighting key insights and areas for improvement as we look towards the future of data orchestration at Wix.
