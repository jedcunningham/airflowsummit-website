As Apache Airflow evolves, a key shift is emerging: the move from task-centric to data-aware orchestration. Traditionally, Airflow has focused on managing tasks efficiently, with limited visibility into the data those tasks manipulate. However, the rise of data-centric workflows demands a new approach—one that puts data at the forefront.

This talk will explore how embedding deeper data insights into Airflow can align with modern users’ needs, reducing complexity and enhancing workflow efficiency. We’ll discuss how this evolution can transform Airflow into a more intuitive and powerful tool, better suited to today’s data-driven environments.
