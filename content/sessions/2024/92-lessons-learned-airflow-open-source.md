Apache Airflow is an essential piece of the data infrastructure for many organizations and has been largely adopted by data engineers across domains for orchestration. Due to its open-source nature, there are varied strategies to operate Airflow, resulting in different challenges. In this talk, we will explore common challenges when Airflow users operate it as an open source software, and the lessons learned. Such lessons should be applicable for operating other open source softwares as well.
