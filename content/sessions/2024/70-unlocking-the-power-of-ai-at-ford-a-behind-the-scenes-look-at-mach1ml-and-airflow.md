Ford Motor Company is undergoing a significant transformation, embracing AI and Machine Learning to power its smart mobility strategy, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation in the automotive industry. Mach1ML, Ford's multi-million dollar ML platform, plays a crucial role in this journey by empowering data scientists and engineers to efficiently build, deploy, and manage ML models at scale. This presentation will delve into how Mach1ML leverages Apache Airflow as its orchestration layer to tackle the challenges of complex ML workflows that include disparate systems, manual processes, security concerns, and deployment complexities. We will explore the benefits of using Airflow, such as increased efficiency, improved reliability, enhanced scalability, and faster time-to-value. Additionally, we will showcase how Mach1ML utilizes Airflow capabilities to generate reusable templates and streamline environment promotions to further empower Ford's AI practitioners and accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge AI-powered solutions supporting the next generation of vehicles.
