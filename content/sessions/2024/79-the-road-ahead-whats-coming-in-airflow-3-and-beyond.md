Apache Airflow has emerged as the defacto standard for data orchestration. Over the last couple of years, Airflow has also seen increasing adoption for ML and AI use cases. It has been almost four years since the release of Airflow 2 and as a community we have agreed that it’s time for a major foundational release in the form of Airflow 3. 
 
 
 
 This talk will introduce the vision behind Airflow 3, including the emerging technology trends in the industry and how Airflow will evolve in response. Specifically, this will include an overview of the architectural changes in Airflow to support emerging use cases and distributed data infrastructure models. This talk will also introduce the major features and the desired outcomes of the release. Airflow 3 will be a foundational release and therefore this talk will similarly introduce the new concepts being introduced as part of Airflow 3, which may be fully realized in follow-on 3.x releases.
 
 
 
 The goal of this talk is to raise awareness about Airflow 3 and to get feedback from the Airflow community while the release is still in the development phase.
