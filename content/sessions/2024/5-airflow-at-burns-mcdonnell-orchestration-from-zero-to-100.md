As the largest employee-owned engineering and construction firm in the United States, Burns & McDonnell has a massive amount of data. Not only that, it’s hard to pinpoint which source system has the data we need. Our solution to this challenge is to build a unified information platform — a single source of truth where all of our data is searchable, trustworthy, and accessible to our employee-owners and the projects that need it.
 
 
 
 Everyone's data is important and everyone's use case is a priority, so how can we get this done quickly? In this session, I will tell you all about how we went from having zero knowledge in Airflow to ingesting many unique and disconnected data sources into our data lakehouse in less than a day. 
 
 
 
 Come hear the story about how our data team at Burns & McDonnell is using Airflow as an orchestrator to create a scalable, trustworthy data platform that will empower our system to evolve with the ever-changing technology landscape.
