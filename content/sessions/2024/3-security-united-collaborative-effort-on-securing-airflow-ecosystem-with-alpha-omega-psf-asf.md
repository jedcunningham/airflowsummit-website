Airflow's power comes from its vast ecosystem, but securing this intricate web requires a united front. This talk unveils a groundbreaking collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation (PSF), the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the Airflow Project Management Committee (PMC), and Alpha-Omega Fund - aimed at securing not only Airflow, but the whole ecosystem. We'll explore this new project dedicated to improving security across the Airflow landscape.
