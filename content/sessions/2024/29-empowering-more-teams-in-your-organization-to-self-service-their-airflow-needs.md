Does your organization feel like the responsibility to write Airflow DAGs, handle the Airflow infrastructure administration, debug failing tasks, and keep up with new features and best practices is too much for too few people? Perhaps you only have one data team that owns all of that; or you have too many teams that have too many permissions into other teams' DAGs.
 
The topic of this talk is how Rakuten Kobo enables self-service for various teams within its organization to build their own DAGs in Airflow. The talk will include how we delineate the Airflow responsibilities of various teams, build guard rails for new Airflow developers, how different teams automatically have permissions required for their "own" DAGs (but not others), the unique responsibilities of Operations and Data Engineering teams, and how it is done in a scalable manner. 
 
Maybe you'll be inspired to make changes in your own organization, or have some tips of your own to share! Depending on questions, we could discuss some of the technical details as well.
