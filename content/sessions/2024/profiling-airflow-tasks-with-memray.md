Profiling Airflow tasks can be difficult, specially in remote environments. In this talk I will demonstrate how we can leverage the capabilities of Airflow's plugin mechanism to selectively run Airflow tasks within the context of a profiler and with the help of operator links and custom views make the results available to the user.
The content of this talk can provide inspiration on how Airflow may in the future allow the gathering of custom task metrics and make those metrics easily accessible.
