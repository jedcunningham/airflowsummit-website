It has been nearly 4 years since the launch of Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) by AWS. It has gone through the trials and tribulations as with any new idea, working with customers to better understand its shortcomings, building dedicated teams focused on scaling and growth, and at its core, preserving the integrity and functionality of Apache Airflow. Initially launched with Airflow 1.10, MWAA is now available globally in multiple AWS regions supporting the latest version of Airflow along with a multitude of features. In this talk, we will cover a bit of that history along with debunking a few myths surrounding the critical needs for users today. From compliance requirements, larger environments, observability, and pricing, we will discuss how MWAA has evolved and continues to grow through its focus on customer value and more importantly, its dedication to the Apache Airflow community.
