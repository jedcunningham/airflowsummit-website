Balyasny Asset Management (BAM) is a diversified global investment firm founded in 2001 with over $20 billion in assets under management. 
 
As dbt took hold at BAM, we had multiple teams building dbt projects against Snowflake, Redshift, and SQL Server. The common question was: How can we quickly and easily productionise our projects? 
 
Airflow is the orchestrator of choice at BAM, but our dbt users ranged from Airflow power users to people whoâ€™d never heard of Airflow before. We built a single solution on top of Cosmos that allowed us to: 
 
 - Decouple the dbt project from the Airflow repository  
 - Have each dbt node run as a separate Airflow task 
 - Allow users to run dbt with little to no Airflow knowledge 
 - Enable users to have fine-grained control over how dbt is run and to combine it with other Airflow tasks 
 - Provide observability, monitoring, and alerting.
