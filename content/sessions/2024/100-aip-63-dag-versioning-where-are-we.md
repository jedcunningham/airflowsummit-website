Join us as we check in on the current status of AIP-63: DAG Versioning. This session will explore the motivations behind AIP-63, the challenges faced by Airflow users in understanding and managing DAG history, and how it aims to address them. From tracking TaskInstance history to improving DAG representation in the UI, we'll examine what we’ve already done and what’s next. We'll also touch upon the potential future steps outlined in AIP-66 regarding the execution of specific DAG versions.
