Data engineers have shifted from delivering data for internal analytics applications to customer-facing data products. And with that shift comes a whole new level of operational rigor necessary to instill trust and confidence in the data. How do you hold data pipelines to the same standards as traditional software applications? Can you apply principles learned from the field of SRE to the world of data?

In this talk, we’ll explore how we’ve seen this evolve in Astronomer’s customer base and highlight best practices learned from the most critical data product applications we’ve seen. We’ll hear from Astronomer’s own data team as they went through the transformation from analytics to data products. And we’ll showcase a new product we’re building to help data teams around the world solve exactly this problem!
