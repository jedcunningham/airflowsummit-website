We are excited to introduce Domino, an open-source software built on top of Apache Airflow that addresses key challenges in modern data workflows. Domino features two primary innovations:

1) An intuitive no-code visual interface that enables non-programmers to build, run, and manage advanced data workflows (analogous to Airflow tasks).

2) A carefully designed standard for writing and distributing modular functions (analogous to Airflow tasks), which become immediately available to be installed and reused by anyone in the world, directly in the visual interface.

Domino relies on Airflow as its workflowsâ€™ orchestration engine, which grants it robustness and reliability. Domino is also designed to operate as a plugin application to running Airflow deployments, with minimal extra installations required and no interference in existing ongoing DAGs.

Domino aims to strengthen community culture by promoting good practices in code reusability and workflow reproducibility. It also empowers non-programmers to become active participants in the user community!
