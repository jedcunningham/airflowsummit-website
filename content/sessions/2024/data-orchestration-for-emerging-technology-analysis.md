The Center for Security and Emerging Technology is a think tank at Georgetown University that studies security implications of emerging technologies, including data-driven analyses across bibliometric, patenting, and investment datasets. This talk will describe CSET's data infrastructure which uses Airflow to orchestrate data ingestion, model deployment, webscraping, and manual data curation pipelines. We'll also discuss how outputs from these pipelines are integrated into public-facing web applications and written reports, and some lessons learned from building and maintaining data pipelines on a data team with a diverse skill set.
