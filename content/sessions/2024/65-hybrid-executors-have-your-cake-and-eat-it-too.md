Executors are a core concept in Apache Airflow and they are an essential piece to the execution of DAGs. They continue to see investment and innovation including a new feature launching this year: Hybrid Execution.
 
This talk will give a brief overview of executors, how they work and what they are responsible for. Followed by a description of Hybrid Executors (AIP-61), a new feature to allow multiple executors to be used natively and seamlessly side by side within a single Airflow environment. We’ll deep dive into how this feature works, how users can make use of it, compare this new feature to what was available before, and finally a demo to see it in action. Don’t miss this chance to learn about the cutting edge capabilities of executors in Apache Airflow!
