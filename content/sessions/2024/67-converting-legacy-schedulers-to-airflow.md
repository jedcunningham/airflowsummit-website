Having helped many customers to migrate thousands of workloads, we will discuss the process of migrations, and how we built an open-source framework to migrate legacy scheduler workflows via standard sets of patterns to Airflow Projects.

This framework is easily extended to encompass schedulers such as Automic, Autosys, Oozie, JAMS, SSIS and others, and has turned a difficult process requiring months or years to a simple one taking days or weeks.
