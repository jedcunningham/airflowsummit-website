Introducing a process and framework to convert legacy scheduler workloads such as Control-M to Airflow using automated transpilation techniques. We will discuss the process and demonstrate a python-based transpiler to automatically migrate legacy scheduler workflows with a standard set of patterns to Airflow DAGs. This framework is easily extended via configurable rulesets to encompass other schedulers such as Automic, Autosys, Oozie, and others.
