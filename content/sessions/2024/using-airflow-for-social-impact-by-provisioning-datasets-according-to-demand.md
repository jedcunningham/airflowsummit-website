We use Airflow to provide datasets for analytics according to user demands and initiatives being undertaken at the time. The ease of ingesting data by dynamically generating and triggering workflows that correspond to configuration files enables efficient workflows and social impact. We use Airflow to empower decision makers by enabling timely provision of datasets that are tested on quality and other metrics using inbuilt Airflow features. These datasets are accessible at a Superset instance and creates an 'on-demand for data' approach to data analysis that is optimized and leads to positive and effective outcomes.
