Are you looking to harness the full potential of data-driven pipelines with Apache Airflow? This session will dive into the newly introduced conditional expressions for advanced dataset scheduling in Airflow - a feature highly requested by the Airflow community. Attendees will learn how to effectively use logical operators to create complex dependencies that trigger DAGs based on the dataset updates in real-world scenarios. We'll also explore the innovative DatasetOrTimeSchedule, which combines time-based and dataset-triggered scheduling for unparalleled flexibility. Furthermore, attendees will discover the latest API endpoints that facilitate external updates and resets of dataset events, streamlining workflow management across different deployments.
 
 
 
 This talk also aims to explain:
 
 - The basics of using conditional expressions for dataset scheduling.
 
 - How do we integrate time-based schedules with dataset triggers?
 
 - Practical applications of the new API endpoints for enhanced dataset management.
 
 - Real-world examples of how these features can optimize your data workflows.
