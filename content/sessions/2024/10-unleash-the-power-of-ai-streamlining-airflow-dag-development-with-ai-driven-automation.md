Nowadays, conversational AI is no longer exclusive to large enterprises. It has become more accessible and affordable, opening up new possibilities and business opportunities. In this session, discover how you can leverage Generative AI as your AI pair programmer to suggest DAG code and recommend entire functions in real-time, directly from your editor. Visualize how to harness the power of ML, trained on billions of lines of code, to transform natural language prompts into coding suggestions. Seamlessly cycle through lines of code, complete function suggestions, and choose to accept, reject, or edit them. Witness firsthand how Generative AI provides recommendations based on the project's context and style conventions. The objective is to equip you with techniques that allow you to spend less time on boilerplate and repetitive code patterns, and more time on what truly matters: building exceptional orchestration software.
