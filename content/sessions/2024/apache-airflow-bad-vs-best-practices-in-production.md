Apache Airflow - The open-ended nature of this orchestration tool gives room for a variety of customization.

While this is a good thing, there are no bounds in which the system can or cannot be used, resulting in wasting a lot of time in scaling, testing, and debugging when things aren't set properly.

In this talk, we will go through a series of factors that data teams need to keep a watch for while setting up an Airflow system.

- Infrastructure 
- Teams and responsibilities
- Development best practices
- Pipeline best practices
- Monitoring and observability
- Fail-proof and recoverable system
