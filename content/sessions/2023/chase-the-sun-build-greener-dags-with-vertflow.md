In 2022, cloud data centres accounted for up to 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, exceeding those of aviation and shipping.

Yet in the same year, Britain wasted 4 Terawatt hours of renewable energy because it couldn't be transported from where it was generated to where it was needed.



So why not move the cloud to the clean energy?



VertFlow is an Airflow operator that deploys workloads to the greenest Google Cloud data centre, based on the realtime carbon intensity of electricity grids worldwide.



At Ovo Energy, many of our batch workloads, like generation forecasts, don't have latency or data residency requirements, so they can run anywhere. We use VertFlow to let them chase the sun to wherever energy is greenest, helping us save carbon on our mission to save carbon.



VertFlow is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/VertFlow/
