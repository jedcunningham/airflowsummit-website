As a data engineer, I've used Airflow extensively over the last 5 years: across 3 jobs, several different roles; for side projects, for critical infrastructure; for manually triggered jobs, for automated workflows; for IT (Ookla/Speedtest.net), for science (Allen Institute for Cell Science), for the commons (Openverse), for liberation (Orca Collective). Authoring a DAG has changed dramatically since 2018, thanks to improvements in both Airflow and the Python language. In this session, we'll take a trip back in time to see how DAGs looked several years ago, and what the same DAGs might look like now. We'll appreciate the many improvements that have been made towards simplifying workflow construction. I'll also discuss the significant advancements that have been made around deploying Airflow. Lastly, I'll give a brief overview of different use cases and ways I've seen Airflow leveraged.
