Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) was released in November 2020. Throughout MWAA's design we held the tenets that this service would be open-source first, not forking or deviating from the project, and that the MWAA team would focus on improving Airflow for everyone—whether they run Airflow on MWAA, on AWS, or anywhere else. 
 
This talk will cover some of the design choices made to facilitate those tenets, how the organization was set up to contribute back to the community, what those contributions look like today, how we’re getting those contributions in the hands of users, and our vision for future engagement with the community.
