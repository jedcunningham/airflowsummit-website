Over the last few years, we've spent countless hours talking to data engineers from everywhere from Fortune 500s to seed stage startups. In doing so, we've learned from all sorts of practitioners on their use cases and what they want from Airflow. By learning from the community, we're really excited to share how Astro, our managed service, makes life easier for data engineers.

We'll share the origin story of Astronomer, why we're so inspired by the Airflow community, and how we see the future of data engineering.
