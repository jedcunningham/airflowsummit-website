Over the last few years, we’ve spent countless hours talking to data engineers from everywhere from Fortune 500s to seed stage startups. In doing so, we’ve learned all about what it takes to deliver a world class Airflow service perfect for everyone. We've packaged all that up into The Astro Hypervisor, a new part of our platform that gives users a whole new level of control in Airflow.

We'll talk through how we've built this hypervisor and how our customers will be able to use it for autoscaling, tracking the health of Airflow environments and so much more.
