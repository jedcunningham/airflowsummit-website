Apache Airflow has over 650 Python dependencies. In case you did not know already, dependencies in Python are difficult subject. And Airflow has its own, custom ways of managing the dependencies. 
 
 
 
 Airflow has a rather complex system to manage dependencies in their CI system, but this talk is not about it. This talk is directed to the users of Airflow who want to keep their dependencies updated, describing ways they can do it.
 
 
 
 This presentation will explain how to effectively manage and handle custom dependencies in Airflow. Jarek will guide you through practical solutions and best practices to make your Airflow experience with dependencies - yes you guessed it - a breeze.
