This will be a hands on keyboard, interactive workshop where we'll walk through how to take data from a public API, move it into a DuckDb instance, and then use Streamlit to build a dashboard on top. At the end, the user will have a streamlit app that gives historical data information based on a city they've input.

This entire workshop can run from the user's laptop via Docker, or by using Github codespaces.

This workshop is designed for anyone new to Airflow, or someone who wants a refresher on concepts like datasets, dynamic tasks, or more introductory material.
