New to Airflow or haven’t followed any of the recent DAG authoring enhancements? This talk is for you!
 
 
 
 We will go through various DAG authoring features like Setup/Teardown tasks (~2.7), Datasets (2.4), Dynamic Tasks (2.3) and Async tasks (2.2). You won’t be an expert after this short talk, however, you’ll have a head start when you write your next DAG, no hacks required.
