You've got your pipelines flowing ... how much do you know about the data inside?
 
Most teams have some coverage with unit/contract/expectations tests, and you might have other quality checks. But it can be very ad-hoc and disorganized. You want to do more to beef up data quality and observability ... does that mean you just need to write more tests and assertions?
  
Come learn about the best way to see your data's quality alongside DAGs in a familiar context. We'll review 3 common tools to get a handle on quality in a cohesive way across all your DAGs:
 
 - Great Expectations
 - Monte Carlo Data
 - Databand
