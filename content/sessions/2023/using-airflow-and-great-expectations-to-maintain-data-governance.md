This use case review will demonstrate how the NGCP team at Carvana uses Great Expectations within Airflow DAGs to ensure Data Governance and Data Quality across their systems. Additionally, it will discuss the overlap between both governance and quality and how Airflow makes that merge essentially seamless. Finally, it will touch on future plans and ideas to build out the platform by using the information to alert on data drift and anomaly detection, and how both will better inform data stewards on current data health.
