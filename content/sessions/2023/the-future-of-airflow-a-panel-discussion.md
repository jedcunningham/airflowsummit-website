Airflow is almost 10 years old! Since starting out at AirBnB, the project has taken all sorts of twists and turns before getting to where it is now. Through it's lifecycle, Airflow has seen an explosion of contributors (over 2400 and counting), end users, use cases, and so much more.

This panel will be about the future of Airflow and where it's going. We'll hear from some of the oldest, and newest, faces in the community about the project's direction and vision as we turn towards the next decade of the project's lifecycle.
