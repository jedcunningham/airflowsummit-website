The session will cover capabilities of data lineage in Apache Airflow, how to use them, and motivations for it. It will present the technical know-how of integrating data lineage solutions with Apache Airflow, and provisioning DAGs metadata to fuel lineage functionalities in a way transparent to the user, limiting the setup friction. It will include Google’s Cloud Composer lineage integration implemented through the current Airflow’s data lineage architecture, and our approach to the lineage evolution strategy.
