For those of us who already know how important open source is, it can
be challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because we
assume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work against
us, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescending
or concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.

In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does management
actually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how to
make decisions about consuming open source, contributing to open
source, and open sourcing company code?
