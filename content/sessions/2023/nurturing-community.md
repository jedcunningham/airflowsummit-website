Nurturing a healthy open source community is hard work and requires discipline. There’s a lot of inherent friction in a distributed community that makes it difficult for the many participants to collaborate. It is challenging to contribute something when you’re new to a community. It is overwhelming for maintainers to give enough attention to contributors when a project becomes popular. In this talk, I’ll go over the common pitfalls of open source communities and will go over practices that contribute to keeping your community healthy.
