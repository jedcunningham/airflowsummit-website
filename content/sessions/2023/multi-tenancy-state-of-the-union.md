This sesion is about the current state of implementation for multi-tenancy feature of Airflow. This is a long-term feature that involves multiple changes, separate AIPs to implement, with the long-term vision of having single Airflow instance supporting multiple, independed teams using it - either from the same company or as part of Airflow-As-A-Service implementation.
