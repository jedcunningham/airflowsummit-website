ETL data pipelines are the bread and butter of data teams that must design, develop, and author DAGs to accommodate the various business requirements. 

dbt is becoming one of the most used tools to perform SQL transformations on the Data Warehouse, allowing teams to harness the power of queries at scale. 
 
Airflow users are constantly finding new ways to integrate dbt with the Airflow ecosystem and build a single pane of glass where Data Engineers can manage and administer their pipelines.
 
Astronomer Cosmos, an open-source product, has been introduced to integrate Airflow with dbt Core seamlessly. Now you can easily see your dbt pipelines fully integrated on Airflow.

You will learn the following:
 * How to integrate dbt Core with Airflow
 * How to use Cosmos 
 * How to build data pipelines at scale
