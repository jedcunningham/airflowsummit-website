Airflow is almost 10 years old! Since starting out at AirBnB, the project has taken all sorts of twists and turns before getting to where it is now. Through its lifecycle, Airflow has seen an explosion of contributors (over 2400 and counting), end users, use cases, and so much more. This panel, moderated by Marc Lamberti, will be about some of the faces that have helped make Airflow what it is. You'll hear from some of the most seasoned, and newest faces, about how the project has changed over the years, the community around it, and where they see it headed.
