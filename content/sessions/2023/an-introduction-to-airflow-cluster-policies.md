Cluster Policies are an advanced Airflow feature composed of a set of hooks that allow cluster administrators to implement checks and mutations against certain core Airflow constructs (DAGs, Tasks, Task Instances, Pods).
 
In this talk, we will discuss how cluster administrators can leverage these functions in order to better govern the workloads that are running in their environments.
