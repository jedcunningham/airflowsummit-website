Airflow is a powerful tool for orchestrating complex data workflows, which have undergone significant changes over the past two years.
 
 Since the Airflow release cycle has accelerated, you may struggle to keep up with the continuous flow of new features and improvements, which can lead to miss opportunities for addressing new use cases or solving your existing ones more efficiently.
 
 This presentation is intended to give you a solid update on the possibilities of Airflow and address misconceptions you may have heard or still believe that used to be valid but no longer are.
 
 At the end of this session, you will be able to use the essential features of Airflow, such as the Taskflow API, Datasets, or Dynamic Task Mapping, and you will know precisely what Airflow can and can't do today.
