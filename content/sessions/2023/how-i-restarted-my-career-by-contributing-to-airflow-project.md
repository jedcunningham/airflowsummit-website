This talk is about how I filled a gap in my career by contributing to Apache Airflow and how it helped for the next step ahead in my career.
 
 why Airflow?:
 
 It has all the moving pieces similar to the experience that you get when working on an enterprise project. You can see the Airflow project is structured in such a way that it has code contribution around core features, clean documentation, test coverage, build ci/cd pipelines, tools for ease of development, several third-party providers, API endpoints, and example dags. Contributing to one of these places was a great way to gain experience during my career break. 
 
 Learning phase:
 
 About my experience in collaborating with the Airflow community, helping other new contributors, checking the GitHub issues, reading PRs by other contributors, and reading chats in the Slack channel to understand the project in depth.
 
 Conclusion:
 
 How I found a work that allows me to work closely with Airflow and paves way for more contributions to Airflow.
