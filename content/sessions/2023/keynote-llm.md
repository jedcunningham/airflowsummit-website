With the emergence of Generative AI and growing interest in LLM-based enterprise applications, there has been an expansion of data integration patterns. Enterprises wanting to use their private data to power LLM-based applications are facing challenges in moving beyond experimentation.

This talk focuses on the data integration patterns using Apache Airflow to support LLM applications created using private enterprise data. This also includes a proposal to add additional Airflow Providers to make it easier to interact with LLMs such as the ones from OpenAI (such as GPT4) and the ones on HuggingFace, while working with both structured and unstructured data.

Using a couple of actual examples, this walks through how Enterprise data can add context to LLM applications using Airflow, seamlessly leveraging the hundreds of already existing Airflow integrations.

Finally, this shows how these Airflow patterns enable reliable, traceable, and scalable LLM applications within the enterprise.
