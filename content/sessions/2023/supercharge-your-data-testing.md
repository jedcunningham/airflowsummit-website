Are you tired of spending countless hours testing your data pipelines, only to find that they don't work as expected? Do you wish there was a better way to manage your data versions and streamline your testing processes?

If so, this presentation is for you!

Join us as we explore the problem domain of testing environments for data pipelines and take a deep dive into the available tools currently in use. We'll introduce you to the game-changing concepts of data versioning and lakeFS and show you how to integrate these tools with Airflow to revolutionize your testing workflows.

But don't just take our word for it - witness this power firsthand with a live demo of testing an Airflow DAG on a snapshot of production data, providing a practical demo of the tools and techniques covered in the presentation.

So don't miss out on this opportunity to supercharge your testing processes and take your data pipelines to the next level.
