It should be no surprise to the Airflow community that the hype around generative large language models (LLMs) and their wildly-inventive chat front ends have brought significant attention to growing these models and feeding them on a steady diet of data.  For many communities in the infrastructure, orchestration, and data landscape this is an opportunity to think big, help our users scale, and make the right foundational investments to sustain that growth over the long term.


In this keynote I’ll talk about my own community, Kubernetes, and how we’re using the surge in AI/ML excitement to address long standing gaps and unlock new capabilities.  Not just for the workloads using GPUs and the platform teams supporting them, but thinking about how we can accelerate Airflow users and other key automators of workflow.  We're all in this together, and the future of orchestration is moving mountains of data at the speed of light!
