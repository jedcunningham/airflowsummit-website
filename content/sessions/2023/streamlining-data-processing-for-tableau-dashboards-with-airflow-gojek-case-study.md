With millions of orders per day, Gojek needs a data processing solution that can handle a high volume of data. Airflow is a scalable tool that can handle large volumes of data and complex workflows, making it an ideal solution for Gojek's needs.



With Airflow, we can create automated data pipelines to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into dashboards such as Tableau for analysis and visualization. This eliminates the need for manual data transfers and reduces the risk of errors. 



Airflow also can be integrated with other systems such as Google BigQuery. This allows us to easily connect to different data sources and transform the data before loading it into the dashboards. Therefore we can create seamless data pipelines. Using Airflow will also reduce query volume in Google BigQuery, resulting in lower cost of overall data infrastructure.
