As we had previously explained, in the best interest for the safety of the Apache Airflow community, the Airflow Summit will be completely digital this year. We now have the dates, the Airflow Summit will be held from July 6th to 17th.
And to make the event accessible to everyone, we are excited to announce that we will be making all core content free of charge.

We are very excited by the quality and quantity of talk submissions. We look forward to helping to get this content and experiences of the speakers out into the world, and the discussions that follow. Talks and workshops will be held during 4 hours each day of the summit.

We encourage everyone in the Apache Airflow community to attend the event, and we will work with our partners to promote the event.

Sponsorship is still available, and we believe that the global scale of the event will bring  interesting benefits to your organization. Please take a look at our [Prospectus](https://airflowsummit.org/docs/AirflowSummit-Prospectus.pdf) and contact us if you are interested in supporting this event.
