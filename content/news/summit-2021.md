### Airflow Summit is coming back for 2021!

The event will be from May 20 to May 28, 2021. The first two days (May 20-21) we plan to have preconference workshops and then the regular talks will be from May 24 to May 28.

Although the 1st Airflow Summit was a huge success, we plan to improve on it and hope to make this year's event even better. For that, the first thing we need is the participation from the community by sharing all the amazing things that you are doing with Apache Airflow.

Please participate by submitting to our CFP which is open now at https://sessionize.com/airflow-summit-2021/
