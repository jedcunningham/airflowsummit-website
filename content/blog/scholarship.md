<h2 class="text-center">Airflow Summit 2024 - Scholarship application</h2>

If you are interested in attending Airflow Summit 2024, but you do not have the resources to purchase your pass or you require travel support, we invite you to apply for a scholarship, there is a possibility of supporting you beyond your pass.

Not all questions are required, but the more information you provide us, the easier it will be for us to approve your scholarship. Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Scholarships are NOT transferable to another person, or any other event. Selection will be made by the organizer committee, who will assess each applicantâ€™s request.

There is no incorrect answer. What we seek through the scholarships is to have a more inclusive event, and to increase the diversity of the participants. 

Scholarship recipients will receive a complimentary pass to attend the event, and up to $1,500 USD to reimburse actual travel expenses. Please note that reimbursements are made after the event, and the stipend may only be used for the following: coach airfare, hotel / accommodations (up to three nights). 

We are on a limited budget, so we do not guarantee that we will be able to approve all applications.

You have until **June 14, 2024** to apply.

All the information provided in this form will only be used for the evaluation of scholarships, after the event the scholarship application information will be deleted.
