Nowâ€¦ [the CfP is open!](https://sessionize.com/airflow-summit-2024/) We are ready to find the cornerstones of this conference. The topics we will be considering this year are: 


* Airflow Intro talks: Gentle introduction to Airflow for new Airflow users

* New features: Using the new features of Airflow for experienced Airflow users

* Use Cases: Using Airflow for various sizes of businesses

* Committer/Roadmap: What new things are coming to Airflow and why

* Airflow as a platform: Building on top of Airflow to make it more powerful

* Community: See below for a more detailed description

* Workshops: Any content relevant to Airflow (2-3 hours)

<br>

### Community-related talks

There will also be all kinds of non-coding and diverse skilled members of the community who do not necessarily code but contribute to the overall health and strength of the community - this will be a great chance to meet them and see some of the talks. If you have a subject that you would like to submit in that area - you are more than welcome!
