      One thing I love about the Airflow Summit is hearing from people  
      all over the world. It's so cool when a presenter located thousands 
      of miles away from me shares something that I find useful and we're able to then connect 
      afterwards on the Airflow community Slack and to learn from each other.

      I was amazed to see that so many of the world's biggest & tech-savvy companies are heavily invested 
      in Apache Airflow. Seeing how Airflow seamlessly integrated with their infrastructure & playing a crucial 
      role in their mission-critical ETL/DS/ML pipelines was mind-blowing.

      It can be hard to keep up with all the great things going on in the Airflow community. 
      For me the Airflow Summit is my chance to focus and learn the practices and technology that allow us to push 
      our Airflow installations to meet their full potential.
